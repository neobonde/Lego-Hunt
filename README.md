## Summary of concept
LEGO HUNT is a team-oriented treasure-hunting game that combines augmented reality and LEGOs to challenge pupils in various disciplines. LEGO HUNT is about creating fun and engaging learning experiences for children through the use of other technologies to innovate education.

What is LEGO HUNT?
Our idea can be identified as a treasure hunting game made for the American K-12 age-group. These participants have to form groups to complete as many challenges as possible before the timer runs out. For every challenge they complete, they will earn LEGOs. Each challenge will challenge them in a random disciplinary like math or geometry but also creative thinking and more. When they have completed the challenge, they will have a LEGO construction that they will bring back to their base. Upon arrival, they will receive points for this solution and be given a new destination to explore and complete another challenge. After a period of time they can't complete anymore challenges, and they will have a collection of LEGOs that they will use to make a creative LEGO solution and earn more LEGO-points. After this, a 1st, 2nd and 3rd place will be awarded to the leading teams.

So, basically, LEGO HUNT is a tool for teachers to engage children in new learning experiences. They will have the ability to scale these challenges based on the appropriate level for their pupils.

LEGO HUNT functions through an app where kids can see new challenge locations, scan AR stickers and see leaderboard for the other teams.

## Challenges we ran into
We ran into two challenges. Initially, we discovered that we were too ambitious with what we thought was possible with AR in this limited time scenario. But we quickly, found a plan B we had prepared in case we wouldn't be able to create what we did. Furthermore, we had a software problem that took some time to solve, but when we found the solution it felt great.

##Accomplishments that we're proud of
We did not know each other before-hand, and still we worked very great together. When we got together, we agreed that we wanted to do the LEGO challenge, and after an ideation process we came up with the concept for the app. After this, we made a plan on what we wanted to achieve and who was responsible for what. And slowly throughout the hackathon, we all participated with a great level of effort in achieving an implementation and a design of this concept.

## Our roles
With little-to-no sleep, Nicolai Bonde worked on the implementation of the AR technology and the development of the app, Caglar Araz primarily outlined the concept and the designs of visual materials, Mikkel worked on the AR technology as well. But, we continuously had various roles where we had to make quick decisions as this was our first time working on a concept like this.

## What we learned
So much! Working with students from other disciplines, learning to find plan Bs in case plan A doesn't function. Learning what's possible with AR. And a lot more.

## What's next for LEGO HUNT
That LEGO hires us and allows us to finalize the concept and make a proper implementation. ;-)
